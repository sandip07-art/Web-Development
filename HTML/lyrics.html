            Kiss me hard before you go
            Summertime sadness
            I just wanted you to know
            That, baby, you the best
            I got my red dress on tonight
            Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
            Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
            High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
            Oh my God, I feel it in the air

            Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
            Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
            Nothin' scares me anymore (one, two, three, four)
            Kiss me hard before you go
            Summertime sadness
            
            I just wanted you to know
            That, baby, you the best
            I got that summertime, summertime sadness
            Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
            Got that summertime, summertime sadness
            Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
            
            I'm feelin' electric tonight
            Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
            Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
            I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
            Oh my God, I feel it in the air
            Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
            
            Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
            Nothin' scares me anymore (one, two, three, four)
            Kiss me hard before you go
            Summertime sadness
            I just wanted you to know
            That, baby, you the best
            
            I got that summertime, summertime sadness
            Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
            Got that summertime, summertime sadness
            Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
            Think I'll miss you forever
            Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
            
            Later's better than never
            Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
            I got that summertime, summertime sadness
            Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
            Got that summertime, summertime sadness
            
            Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
            Kiss me hard before you go
            Summertime sadness
            I just wanted you to know
            That, baby, you the best
            I got that summertime, summertime sadness
            
            Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
            Got that summertime, summertime sadness
            Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
